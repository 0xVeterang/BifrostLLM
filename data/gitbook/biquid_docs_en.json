Follow through the Getting Started with Biquid section to successfully understand the way Biquid works.\nBefore getting started, you must connect your wallet and change its network to Bifrost network. This is as the assets used in Biquid (BFC, stBFC, wstBFC) are all supported on the Bifrost network.\nWhen you first enter the website, click the Stake button to get started with the staking process.\nAfter clicking Stake, there are 4 additional pages (Stake, Wrap, Dashboard, Withdraw) for access. Let‚Äôs learn about what each pages provide!\nStake\nOn the Stake page, users can stake BFC and choose whether to recieve wstBFC or stBFC. While earning staked profits, users can additionally utilize (w)stBFC like traditional crypto assets through DeFi protocols, as well as exchanging back to BFC whenever needed.\nWhat is Staking?\nStaking is a process where users deposit a certain amount of crypto assets they own in return for interest. The process is very similar to traditional banking, where interest is earned on deposits. By staking cryptocurrency, it contributes to the security of a blockchain network, therefore receiving rewards by providing added security. Improving a network‚Äôs security provides a trustable system for anyone.\nWhat are wstBFC and stBFC?\nwstBFC and stBFC are tokens that can be freely utilized once BFC is staked.

    "content": "DEEP DIVE INTO BIQUID\nDeep Dive into Biquid\nWhat is Liquid Staking?\nLiquid staking is a breakthrough that overcomes the lock-up issue of traditional staking. In traditional staking, the staked cryptocurrency is locked up on the network for a period of time and cannot be freely used, although some rewards are received periodically. Liquid staking solves this problem by giving users who stake liquid staking derivatives(LSD), which are tokens that represent their staked assets. Users can then freely utilize these tokens on other DeFi platforms while still receiving the staking rewards, allowing them to get the benefits of staking and liquidity at the same time.\nStaked cryptocurrency is delegated to Validators, helping to strengthen the security of the network. Validators use this cryptocurrency to create new blocks and validate transactions, and are compensated with cryptocurrency in return. The rewards are distributed between validators and stakers. Typically, validators take a portion of the reward as a fee, and the rest is distributed to stakers in proportion to the amount of cryptocurrency they've staked.\nLearn More About Biquid\nBifrost Liquid Staking (Biquid) is a solution that allows you to monetize by staking BFC and utilizing your staked BFC in various DeFi. When you stake BFC, you will receive stBFC or wstBFC, which can be exchanged back to BFC whenever you want, and can be used for additional profit. The staked BFC is then delegated to validators and used to increase the security of the Bifrost network. Finally, if a user requests to unstake, they will become withdrawable after the unstaking period, and their BFC will be withdrawn when they request a withdrawal.\nWhat happens if a validator with staked BFC shuts down their node operations?\nBFC staked to that validator will be automatically unstaked and automatically re-staked to another validator via a smart contract. Please note that this has almost no effect on the amount of staked BFC and rewards.\nStaking Cryptocurrency: BFC\nBiquid offers users a way to stake BFC. BFC is the native coin of the Bifrost network and is utilized for various purposes related to the operation of the network. BFC can be easily purchased on the exchanges listed below.\nUpbit(BFC/BTC)\nUpbit(BFC/BTC)\nBithumb(BFC/KRW)\nBithumb(BFC/KRW)\nKuCoin(BFC/USDT)\nKuCoin(BFC/USDT)\nGate.io (BFC/USDT, BFC/ETH)\nGate.io (BFC/USDT, BFC/ETH)\nHTX(BFC/USDT)\nHTX(BFC/USDT)\nCryptology(BFC/USDT)\nCryptology(BFC/USDT)\nKorbit(BFC/KRW)\nKorbit(BFC/KRW)\nLiquidity Staking Derivatives: stBFC & wstBFC\nOnce you complete staking, you will receive either stBFC or wstBFC. The holder of the (w)stBFC is considered a participant in the staking, and will receive periodic staking rewards accordingly. This means that even if you utilize your (w)stBFC on another DeFi platform, you will continue to receive staking rewards as long as you retain ownership. However, if you swap your (w)stBFC for another cryptocurrency or use it to unstake, you will lose ownership and will no longer be eligible for staking rewards. In other words, ownership of (w)stBFC is a key factor in determining whether or not you are a staking participant.\nstBFC\nstBFC is a rebasing token that earns interest in a way that increases in quantity over time, which means that the stBFC you own will automatically increase in quantity based on your staking rewards. As a result, the exchange ratio between stBFC and BFC remains 1:1.\nwstBFC\nwstBFC is a reward-bearing token that accrues interest in a way that increases the value of wstBFC relative to BFC over time, which means that the amount of wstBFC you own does not change, but the amount of BFC you can exchange for 1 wstBFC automatically increases based on your staking rewards.\nstBFC vs wstBFC\nThe main difference between stBFC and wstBFC is how interest is reflected. For example, let's compare two scenarios where you stake 100 BFC with an annualized return of 10% and are given 100 stBFC and 100 wstBFC. If you are given 100 stBFC, after one year, the amount of stBFC you own will increase to 110 stBFC. On the other hand, if you were given 100 wstBFC, your quantity remains the same at 100 wstBFC, but the amount of BFC you can exchange for 1 wstBFC increases by 10%. In both cases, you will end up with 110 BFC to withdraw after one year.\nAs you can see above, stBFC and wstBFC have different properties, which makes them suitable for different DeFi services. First, stBFC can be useful in DeFi where the growth of quantity is directly impacted. For example, services that support Yield Farming, where interest and principal are traded or managed separately, may be better suited for stBFC. On the other hand, wstBFC can be conveniently utilized in DeFi services where a fixed quantity of tokens is important. For example, when using wstBFC as collateral in a lending protocol, the landing protocol does not need to account for token quantity fluctuations because the token quantity is fixed.\nCan I exchange stBFC and wstBFC?\nBiquid offers the facility to exchange stBFC and wstBFC for free through wrapping and unwrapping. For more information, please refer to Wrap!\nDelegating to a Validator\nStaked BFC are delegated to the best validator in terms of profitability and reliability, who then uses them to enhance the security of the Bifrost network. Validators validate transactions and create new blocks according to the rules of the network. In the process, rewards are distributed to both validators and delegators.\nUnstake and withdraw\nUnstaking is the process of unlocking staked BFC to be used again. Users can request unstaking using stBFC or wstBFC, and their BFC will be withdrawable after the unstaking period.\nWhen a user requests unstaking, the stBFC used for the request is burned and a Withdrawal NFT is issued with information such as the date and quantity of the unstaking request. After the unstaking period, the user can then request a withdrawal of BFC via the Withdrawal NFT, and BFC will be withdrawn based on the information in the NFT. Once the withdrawal is complete, the Withdrawal NFT is burned.\nWithdrawal NFT?\nThe Withdrawal NFT is a tool for the process from unstaking to withdrawal. If you don't see the NFT in your wallet, it's still in your account, don't worry!\nLast updated 2 months ago",

    "content": "DEEP DIVE INTO BIQUID\nFAQ\nWhat is Bifrost Liquid Staking (Biquid)?\nBifrost Liquid Staking (Biquid) is a solution that allows you to monetize by staking BFC and utilizing your staked BFC in various DeFi. When you stake BFC, you will receive stBFC or wstBFC, which can be exchanged back to BFC whenever you want, and can be used for additional profit.\nHow does Biquid work?\nWhen a user stakes BFC on Bifrost network, they are rewarded with a corresponding amount of (w)stBFC. During this process, BFC is staked internally to the most profitable and trusted validators. Users holding (w)stBFC can periodically receive staking rewards, which can be freely utilized in DeFi. You can also instantly exchange ownership between (w)stBFC and other tokens through decentralized exchanges such as Everdex, or you can unstake to burn your (w)stBFC and withdraw your BFC staked on Bifrost network.\nIs it safe to stake with Biquid?\nBiquid operates on Bifrost Network. Bifrost Network handles a variety of cross-chain communications through cross-validation by mainnet relayers, maintaining superior security likewise L1 protocols. Biquid also introduces a non-custodial staking solution to eliminate counterparty risk, and has been audited by Theori, a global security auditing firm, to further enhance its security credibility.\nWhat are the fees for using Biquid?\nBiquid does not charge any fees other than the minimal fees required to operate the nodes and gas fees, and the annual percentage yield takes into consideration of node operating fees. The reason why Biquid doesn't charge additional fees is because our goal is focused on activating Bifrost Network‚Äôs ecosystem.\nWhat is wrapping?\nWrapping is the process of converting an asset into another form to increase usability. In Biquid, the process of converting stBFC to wstBFC is called wrapping, and conversely, the process of converting wstBFC back to stBFC is called unwrapping.\nWhat is stBFC?\nstBFC is a rebasing token that earns interest in a way that increases in quantity over time, which means that the stBFC you own will automatically increase in quantity based on your staking rewards. As a result, the exchange ratio between stBFC and BFC remains 1:1.\nWhat is wstBFC?\nwstBFC is a reward-bearing token that accrues interest in a way that increases the value of wstBFC relative to BFC over time, which means that the amount of wstBFC you own does not change, but the amount of BFC you can exchange for 1 wstBFC automatically increases based on your staking rewards.\nWhere can I use (w)stBFC?\n(w)stBFC can be utilized for a variety of purposes, including collateralizing loans, providing liquidity, and swaps. You can find specific uses in DeFi Integration.\nHow often are staking rewards distributed?\nStaking rewards are distributed every 12 hours.\nWhat should I choose between stBFC and wstBFC as the token to receive when staking?\nSince stBFC and wstBFC have different uses, we recommend that you check the use case of each token in DeFi Integration and choose the appropriate token for your needs. Regardless of which token you choose, there will be no loss to your assets, and you will receive the same staking reward.\nWhere can I use (w)stBFC?\n(w)stBFC can be utilized for a variety of purposes, including collateralizing loans, providing liquidity, and swaps. You can find specific uses in DeFi Integration.\nWhat should I do if I received the wrong token when staking?\nIf you received the wrong token when staking, you can exchange it for the correct token on the wrapping page. For example, if you received stBFC when you needed wstBFC, you can exchange stBFC for wstBFC on the wrapping page.\nHow are staking rewards calculated and represented?\nStaking rewards for stBFC are reflected in an increasing quantity every 12 hours. On the other hand, wstBFC reflects staking rewards by increasing the value of wstBFC every 12 hours. These two values are converted to BFC and then added.\nHow are expected rewards calculated?\nThe expected rewards are calculated by multiplying the current ‚ÄòStaked BFC‚Äô by the expected return per period. The formula is as follows.\nExpected reward after 1 day = Staked BFC * APY / 365\nExpected reward after 1 week = Staked BFC * APY / 52\nExpected reward after 1 month = Staked BFC * APY / 12\nExpected reward after 1 year = Staked BFC * APY\nCan I still receive staking rewards even though I deposit (w)stBFC to other DeFi services?\nYes, you can earn rewards. Rewards and staking updates are automatic on the Biquid dashboard. However, if you use (w)stBFC on other DeFi platforms, rewards won‚Äôt reflect on the dashboard but will still accumulate automatically.\nWhat is a withdrawal?\nWithdrawal is the process of receiving BFC by exchanging with (w)stBFC.\nWhat are the methods of withdrawal?\nThere are two main withdrawal methods.\nWithdrawal without fees after a 7-day unstaking period\nWithdrawal without fees after a 7-day unstaking period\nImmediate withdrawal through a decentralized exchange such as Everdex.\nImmediate withdrawal through a decentralized exchange such as Everdex.\nWhat are the pros and cons of each withdrawal method?\nThe benefit of withdrawal after unstaking is that you don't have to pay any fees, but the downside is that you have to wait for a 7-day unstaking period before you can withdraw. On the other hand, withdrawing through a decentralized exchange has the benefit of immediate withdrawal, but the downside is that you'll have to pay a fee of around 0.3%.\nHow do I make an immediate withdrawal?\nYou can withdraw through decentralized exchanges such as Everdex.\nWhy is the quantity of (w)stBFC received after staking slightly different from the exchange rate?\nThe reason why the quantity of (w)stBFC received when staking is slight different from the exchange rate is because the quantity of staked tokens are managed in terms of shares and are divided in integers.\nDuring this process, decimal values are rounded down (discarded), which can lead to subtle differences. For example, in certain situations, the calculation can result in a difference of 1-2 wei. This is also common in other staked assets, such as staked Ethereum (stETH).\nIf you would like to receive additional (w)stBFC to fill in the difference, try clicking the [Adjust Token Unit] button at the top right corner.\nWhy isn't the [Adjust Token Unit] feature working properly?\nYou can only use this feature up to 20 times per day. Please make sure you haven't exceeded your daily limit. If you haven't and the problem persists, please contact us.\nLast updated 1 month ago",
